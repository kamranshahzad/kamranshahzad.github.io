                <h2><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right icon"></i>&nbsp;Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    During my development tenure I have worked on hundreds of web application. 
                    But I can add only few of them on my profile! Why? Because maximum web apps were 
                    developed for non-serious clients with no business vision, so after a year or so these web apps 
                    failed and clients didn’t even renewed the domains. And some were developed as junk 
                    (based on just do it, deliver rapidly with no security measures, no code quality, no QC, 
                    no application optimization etc). I believe in rapid development but there is no room for compromise 
                    on quality. Unfortunately local software market is all about quantity with no focus on quality and 
                    future perspectives. During my job I always preferred to adopt latest and stable technology according 
                    to project need and market demand. So I was not good fit for majority of local software houses, 
                    then I decide to quit my job and challenge myself by taking a bold decision and start working on my own 
                    ideas to develop a robust product with emphasis on quality, speed, security and scalability. 
                    Working on my own ideas gave me the freedom of choosing top of the line technologies that were best 
                    suited for my product.
                </p>
                
                <h2><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right icon" ></i>&nbsp;Market trends and component development</h2>
                <p>
                    The market of component development for web or mobile application is ever lasting. In this market there is huge space for concrete concepts. A Strong idea with proper execution using proper development flow (Analysis, design, development, testing/QC, documentation, deployment) and marketing strategy leads to successful product. There is no shortcut to achieve goals in this market. A proper team (with perfect skills) and passion could make reputation in component development market. The start is full of obstacles, but the future is bright. Following are some market trends or some reasons why components have extensive demand in the market.
                </p>
                <div class="details-box">
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;Wordpress</h4>
                    <p>
                        WordPress is widely used CMS in small to medium organizations. WordPress is open source with great community. It comes with numbers of themes and extensions. In cost effective components market WordPress is leading CMS. There are many commercial theming frameworks and extensions available. These theming framework help user to change styles of their website and comes with huge number of build-in templates and multipurpose themes. These extensions and components provide solution to a specific business problem.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;Components are cost effective</h4>
                    <p>
                        Buying prebuild components is cost effective instead of the developing whole functionality from scratch. User can choose component according to his needs. Most components come with 1-year software license. During that year user get unlimited support from vender e.g. ticketing, forum and 24/7 email assistance. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;Standardized Code</h4>
                    <p>
                        Commercial components come with well written optimized code. It has extensive support (live chat, tickets, forums etc.) with complete documentation. Component development companies follow market trends to develop their products and use latest and stable technologies. Using prebuild component helps in rapid and cost effective development as compared to developing required functionalities from scratch. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;Migrations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Migration is very important part of software development. Migration has many types like data migration, platform migration, server migration, version migration etc. Every latest CMS or Framework which have popular in market, comes with two types of release. First one is development or beta release, and the second one is stable release. Mostly developer follow the stable release to develop components. Sometime stable release has small bugs/errors; the CMS or Framework vendor release a fix patch (little lines of code) for these bugs/errors. This technique helps user to protect their products from security holes.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;UI Components</h4>
                    <p>
                        UI components are the most demanding product of the component market; these are widely used in web/mobile application development. We can divide any web/mobile application as components, e.g. menus/navigation, slider, image gallery, news ticker etc.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;What customer wants?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mostly component user wants a useful control panel which comes with user friendly features and flexibility and no complex configuration. They want to buy component with single click install and start working. Keeping ease of use in mind, mostly UI components are popular in the market as compare to backed components which comes with complex configuration.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>&nbsp;The enterprise components market</h4>
                    <p>
                        This market belongs to software development agencies or developers only. These components are meant to help build enterprise level application. These components’ come with complex configuration and license is multi-usage, buyer can use this component in as many application as he wishes. This kind of component are costly.
                    </p>
